I decided to start learning programming 3 years ago because I hated my job and wanted something new and interesting. But with my jobs being so demanding physically, I never had the energy or motivation enough to actively persue anything. I've tried some apps, and a few books but nothing kept my interest. Either they were too complicated for me to understand or too hand-holdy and boring. I've heard of bootcamps for a while, but also heard that they were a huge time commitment and super expensive, so I never thought of them as a viable choice. Then, a few months ago, I heard that payment options and at around the same time found out my girlfriend was pregnant. So here I am, with motivation, drive and accessability; the holy trinity.
